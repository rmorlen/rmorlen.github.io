Have you written automation scripts using PowerShell before, but find it hard getting your end users or your support people to use them? Let's solve this with ChatOps.

We will have a quick introduction to ChatOps and then dive into installing a [Errbot](http://errbot.io/en/latest/) (a chat bot) on Windows. After learning the basics of Errbot, we will run through some code examples so you can easily bring your scripts to users through chat. Finally we will touch on what security when it comes to ChatOps with PowerShell.
